# drop'in CLI

## Getting Started

By executing `./dropin` with no sub-command, you access the interactive CLI. It
is the easiest way to setup your environment and create your first Recipes.

When, the **root** directory is created. It is by default at
`~/.dropin.recipes`, but you can change it by setting the environment
variables `DROPIN_ROOT`.
