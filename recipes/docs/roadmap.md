# Roadmap

The development of drop'in was divided into seasons and episodes : we have been going from version to version since 2016 and we are currently at episode 3 of season 5.

During our journey we went through several technical stacks with a multitude of sandboxes which allowed us to progressively establish a set of features and define core concepts.

In previous seasons, drop'in was used as part of [Blue Forest](https://blueforest.cc)'s services to create cross-platform applications for its clients. Today, we have finalized the specifications of drop'in to make it available publicly allowing anyone to build their own applications in total autonomy.

This documentation is in progress, we invite you to visit [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/blue-forest/dropin) to follow the next updates. Starting next episodes, we will post more details on this page.
