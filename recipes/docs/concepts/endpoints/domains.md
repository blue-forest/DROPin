# Domains

Domains allow you to describe a routing on [Pages](/concepts/interfaces/pages/){.cico .cico-pages}, [Triggers](/concepts/automations/triggers/){.cico .cico-triggers} and [Deployments](/concepts/automations/deployments/){.cico .cico-deployments}.

It is possible to manage prefixes and subdomains to organize the structure of your applications.

A [Project](/concepts/catalog/projects/){.cico .cico-projects} must be provided for each routing.
