# Realms

A Realm allows [Organizations](/concepts/owners/organizations){.cico .cico-organizations} to register [Users](/concepts/owners/users){.cico .cico-users} through a combination of email addresses and a password.

When a [Users](/concepts/owners/users){.cico .cico-users} registers in [dropin.cloud](/cloud/), they are using the drop'in Realm. When a User registers on a [Project](/concepts/catalog/projects){.cico .cico-projects} or an [Organization](/concepts/owners/organizations){.cico .cico-organizations} that uses the authentication features of drop'in, he uses the Realm defined by it.

An [Organization](/concepts/owners/organizations){.cico .cico-organizations} may set up a Realm to restrict [Users](/concepts/owners/users){.cico .cico-users} accounts to a single email address or allow the option of using multiple email addresses.
