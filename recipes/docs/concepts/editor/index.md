# Editor

Editor is a [dropin.cloud](/cloud/) service that provide a daily management interface for a data structure based on the [Recipes](/concepts/recipes/){.cico .cico-recipes} of a [Model](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models}. This is a kind of back-office automatically generated from the specifications you defined in your [Project](/concepts/catalog/projects/){.cico .cico-projects}.

To use Editor, the first thing you need to do is to choose one of your Projects for its [Sections](/concepts/editor/sections/){.cico .cico-sections} to be loaded. Each Section describes the content of Editor pages with a real-time display of your data.

In addition to the ability to manage your data, Editor will allow you to trigger Actions that will result in the execution of specific [Functions](/concepts/automations/functions/){.cico .cico-functions}, but also to manage all the Users of your [Realm](/concepts/auth/realms/){.cico .cico-realms} if you have one.

## Interfaces overview

Here are some examples of interfaces that will be available in Editor.

The aesthetics of these interfaces is not finalized and will be greatly evolving before the release of the alpha version, it is here essentially designed to highlight Editor features.

The current shown interfaces are in French, but the final version will obviously be available in English.
