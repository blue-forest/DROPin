# Getters

A Getter allows to access information dynamically.

There are two types of access:

- local, it is information at the level of a [Recipe](/concepts/recipes/)

- external, it is information loaded from another [Recipe](/concepts/recipes/) or a [Collection](/concepts/storage/collections/){.cico .cico-collections} Item

In a text, it is possible to use a Getter to make a text dynamic.
