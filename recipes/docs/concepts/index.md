# Concepts

A drop'in Concept is a set of features that allows you to describe a specific need. In other words, we have created a Concept for each aspect that you may need when creating an application.

You will find all the Concepts available on drop'in in this section. For each Concept, you will find a description of its operation and examples of use.

In addition, thanks to [Studio](/cloud/#studio) you can describe your application without having to write code or know all the specifications of the [Recipes](/concepts/recipes/){.cico .cico-recipes} because all drop'in Concepts are accessible via a graphical interface.
