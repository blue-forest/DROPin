# Concepts

A drop'in Concept is a set of features that allows you to describe a specific need. In other words, we have created a Concept for each aspect that you may need when creating an application.


In this section you will find all the Concepts available on drop'in divided in 10 main categories:

- [Recipes](/concepts/recipes/){.cico .cico-recipes} : highlights the Concepts common to all Recipes
- [Owners](/concepts/owners/){.cico .cico-owners} : highlights Concepts related to [Users](/concepts/owners/users/){.cico .cico-users} and [Organizations](/concepts/owners/organizations/){.cico .cico-organizations} registered on drop'in
- [8 Recipes categories](/concepts/recipes/#categories)

For each Concept, you will find a description of how it works as well as examples of use in the final version of the documentation.

In addition, thanks to [Studio](/cloud/#studio) you can describe your application without having to write code or know all the specifications of the [Recipes](/concepts/recipes/){.cico .cico-recipes} because all drop'in Concepts are accessible via a graphical interface.
