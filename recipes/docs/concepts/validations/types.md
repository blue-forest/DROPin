# Types

Types allow to register and reuse [Formats](/concepts/recipes/formats/) split into Variations.

By using a Type in another [Recipe](/concepts/recipes/), it is possible to test the [Format](/concepts/recipes/formats/) of a data with [Setters](/concepts/recipes/setters/) and to trigger an [Issue](/concepts/validations/issues/){.cico .cico-issues} in case of error.
