# Catalog

Get access to the drop'in Catalog from [dropin.cloud](/cloud/) and discover [Models](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models} and [Projects](/concepts/catalog/projects/){.cico .cico-projects} created by the community.

A point system will be implemented to reward the most popular items and the most active contributors.

Paid items could also be available in the future, based on a subscription model or a one-time payment. Obviously, only certified organizations will be able to publish that kind of items to avoid any potential pricing abuse.
