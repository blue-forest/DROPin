# Editor

Editor provides a daily management interface for a data structure based on the [Recipes](/concepts/recipes/){.cico .cico-recipes} of a [Model](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models}. This is a kind of back-office automatically generated from the specifications you defined in your [Project](/concepts/catalog/projects/){.cico .cico-projects}.

To learn more about the possibilities offered to you by Editor, we invite you to consult the documentation dedicated to [Editor recipes](/concepts/editor/){.cico .cico-editor}.
