# Studio

Studio allows you to describe a logical and visual behavior in the form of [Models](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models}.

For all [Interfaces](/concepts/interfaces/){.cico .cico-interfaces} concepts, Studio will allow you to visualize in real time the changes you make to your application. Via an interactive editor, you can easily manage for example your [Components](/concepts/interfaces/components/){.cico .cico-components} and your [Styles](/concepts/interfaces/styles/){.cico .cico-styles}.

For more algorithmic concepts, Studio will allow you to describe your application in the form of interactive blocks and assemble them to define for example your [Functions](/concepts/automations/functions/){.cico .cico-functions}.

For each concept of a [Model](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models}, Studio will allow you to describe your application without having to write a single line of code. However, if you want to go further, you can still edit the source code of your application directly from Studio.
