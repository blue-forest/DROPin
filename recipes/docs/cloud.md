# dropin.cloud

dropin.cloud is a cloud service provided by [Blue Forest](https://blueforest.cc){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to help you create and manage your applications based on the drop'in technology. It is currently in an alpha phase and is not yet accessible to everyone. If you want to participate in this test phase, you can [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejGbv2SCbZ7xZwpdGSDTqEi3e7eg2FQNmsoZeJWaNxv27Nkw/viewform){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} but be aware that the accesses will not be launched until we have finalized all the necessary preparations.

dropin.cloud ecosystem will be composed of four main services:

- [Studio](#studio): create your applications based on [Models](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models}
- [Editor](/concepts/editor/): daily manage your data structure
- [Catalog](/concepts/catalog/): a marketplace of drop'in [Models](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models} and [Projects](/concepts/catalog/projects/){.cico .cico-projects}
- [Community](#community): a place to share your creations and find inspiration


## Studio
Studio allows you to describe a logical and visual behavior in the form of [Models](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models}.

For all [Interfaces](/concepts/interfaces/){.cico .cico-interfaces} concepts, Studio will allow you to visualize in real time the changes you make to your application. Via an interactive editor, you can easily manage for example your [Components](/concepts/interfaces/components/){.cico .cico-components} and your [Styles](/concepts/interfaces/styles/){.cico .cico-styles}.

For more algorithmic concepts, Studio will allow you to describe your application in the form of interactive blocks and assemble them to define for example your [Functions](/concepts/automations/functions/){.cico .cico-functions}.

For each concept of a [Model](/concepts/catalog/models/){.cico .cico-models}, Studio will allow you to describe your application without having to write a single line of code. However, if you want to go further, you can still edit the source code of your application directly from Studio.

To see some examples of Studio interfaces, here are some pages to consult:

- [Interfaces](/concepts/interfaces/#studio-overview-dropincloud){.cico .cico-interfaces}
- [Automations](/concepts/automations/#studio-overview-dropincloud){.cico .cico-automations}
- [Models](/concepts/catalog/models/#studio-overview-dropincloud){.cico .cico-models}


## Community
Here are some features that we have planned for this service:

- Publications: activity feed linked to the Fediverse with [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- Messages: private messages between users encrypted end-to-end
- Manuals: write and share your documentations privately or publicly
- Translations: tool to easily translate your content
- Tasks: manage your projects with tasks and subtasks
