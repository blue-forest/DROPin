# Contributing

We have not yet established an external development protocol outside Blue Forest but we are open to your participation. Please feel free to contact us at contact@blueforest.cc.

As soon as necessary, we will set up a procedure and a best practices guide in this document to allow any developer to contribute to our code.

Thank you for your interest !
